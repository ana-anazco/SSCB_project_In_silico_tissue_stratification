based on gene expression profiles. \n","Naturally, our model is overfitted due to the low number of samples and features (limitation of the scRNA-seq data). Therefore it requires further training and validation, especially to increase number of samples and  features (besides the selected 22 genes). However, we think that considering all the genes might introduced noise, thus the idea would be to improve feature selection from previous evidence. For example, considering genes that are described to be associated with Huntington's disease as well as markers of specific cell types in the brain. \n","Another aspect that we did not include was a cell type that represents all the other non-specified cell types. This would allow the sum to be is exactly 1. As is, even if the profile does not match a brain cell the neuronal net will try to place it in one of the three cell types. Thus, we think an additional non-specified cell type would improve the results since it will allow the algorithm to purge expression profiles that don't activate nodes for brain cells.
